The game follows the main character Lux, a robot built and designed to destroy all life it finds. 
There is not much known to the user at first as they are thrown into the first-person experience however through the gameplay they will uncover the plot and backstory of this world. 
The world is unknown to the user but is revealed to be a post-apocalyptic planet Earth. It is unknown what left the world in ruins. 
The game does not take place in a specific area, rather in the north american region in the future. 
The year is not known either, sometime after AI was intelligent enough to thrive without human intervention. 
The heads up display acts as a tutorial for the player, and pushes the user to explore and use Lidar to sense its surroundings. 
The environment is not ever revealed outside of the lidar scan, so the creatures are hard to make out to the AI, all life is the same to them. 
Through the gameplay it is revealed that some of the parasites the robot is designed to destroy are human beings. 
For the most part the humans are harmless and have nothing to defend themselves with, allowing for the robot to easily destroy them. 
There are some humans who have the strength to fight back however they are very rare as humanity has been forever crippled. 
The major boss battle in the game is near the end, when lux faces Dr. Jerguson. One of the three original creators of the exterminating robots. 
After Lux wins the fight the user is given a choice whether to let Dr. Jerguson live or to execute him by throwing him off the edge of the highrise building. 
If the user chooses to let him live Dr. Jerguson will push off of Lux and jump to his death regardless. 
Lux goes to the bottom floor and finds Dr. Jerguson crawling away and ends his misery. The game credits then roll.
