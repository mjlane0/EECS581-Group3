The player, a member of a resistance group fighting against the tyrannical rule of the Nox Robots, finally reaches the headquarters of their creator,
Dr. Samuel Jergeson. As the player navigates through the facility, they discover evidence of Jergeson's twisted experiments and atrocities committed against humanity.

As the player reaches the main lab, they are confronted by Jergeson himself, now mutated and augmented by his own creations. Jergeson taunts the player, boasting of 
his intellect and the power of the Nox Robots.

The battle begins, and Jergeson unleashes a horde of Nox Robots to defend himself. The player fights through wave after wave of robots, using their skills and 
weapons to take them down. Meanwhile, Jergeson uses a variety of advanced technology, such as energy shields and powerful lasers, to attack the player.

As the player's health starts to deplete, they notice a console nearby and hack into the Nox's control system. After a long and intense fight, the player 
successfully overrides the Nox Robots' programming and turns them against Jergeson. With the robots now on the player's side, Jergeson's defenses are quickly 
overwhelmed and he is defeated.

As Jergeson lay on the ground, mortally wounded, he pleads with the player to spare him, claiming that he can help them defeat the other Nox Robots. But the player, 
having seen the atrocities committed by Jergeson and his creations, decides to end his life, avenging the countless lives that were lost because of him.

With Jergeson's death and the reprogramming of the Nox Robots, the resistance can now turn the tide of the war and bring freedom to humanity. The game ends with the 
player's character walking away from the burning facility, as they contemplate the sacrifices made and the weight of their actions.
